# DSA-Java
This repository contains all the questions that I have practiced while learning DSA in Java. <br />
The questions I practiced here are from College Wallah Youtube Channel. <br />
I have tried almost every questions taught in the playlist and also added some extra questions whichever I thought I should do. <br />
I will be updating the repo every night before sleeping with the date which will help me to be consitent in the learning phase of my career and I will also get the proper documentation of my solved problems for the future. <br />
